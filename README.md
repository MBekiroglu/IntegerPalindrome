# IntegerPalindrome
This program checks to see if a provided Integer is a palindrome

### How To Run
1. Run Main.java  within the src file with the main() method

### Highlights
1. Works effectively until outside the boundaries of the Integer limit
2. The checker still works regardless of if the values are even or odd
3. The method is efficient
4. Single values work

### Improvements
1. Integer data type applies constraints to the size of the value. This could be changed to a Long.
