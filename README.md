# IntegerPalindrome
This program checks to see if a provided Integer is a palindrome

Mersk-Challenge-number 6
## Project Brief

Check if given Integer is palindrome or not. An integer is called palindrome if it's equal to its reverse, e.g. 1001 is a palindrome, but 1234 is not because the reverse of 1234 is 4321 which is not equal to 1234.

Please write the unit tests for your solution using any of the unit testing framework.
## Dependencies used
* JUnit 5.6.0 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api

### How To Run
1. Run Main.java  within the src file with the main() method

### Highlights
1. Works effectively until outside the boundaries of the Integer limit
2. The checker still works regardless of if the values are even or odd
3. The method is efficient
4. Single values work

### Improvements
1. Integer data type applies constraints to the size of the value. This could be changed to a Long.
